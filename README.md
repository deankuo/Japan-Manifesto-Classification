# Japan Manifesto Classification Using LDA Model
This repository contain the process that how I deal with Japanese manifestos and conduct a LDA model on the data.

I use Python as main language in processing the txt files and build the csv file that can be use for further data cleaning and preprocessing. And I use Qnanteda package in R to run NLP processing, including building corpus, defining and delimiting textual features, and conducting topic modeling and LDA.
